# Cart Management Application

This project is a JavaScript-based cart management system designed for an e-commerce application. It retrieves product data from an API, displays it dynamically on the web page, and allows users to manage their shopping cart and place orders.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Product Rendering**
   - Retrieves and displays product data from a REST API.
   - Generates product cards dynamically on the cart page.

2. **Cart Functionality**
   - Adds products to the cart with selected quantities and colors.
   - Updates product quantities in the cart.
   - Deletes products from the cart.

3. **Total Calculation**
   - Dynamically calculates and displays the total quantity and price of products in the cart.

4. **Form Validation**
   - Validates user input for first name, last name, address, city, and email using regular expressions.

5. **Order Submission**
   - Submits the cart and user information as a POST request to the API.
   - Redirects users to a confirmation page with their order ID.
